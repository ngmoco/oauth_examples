OAuth Examples
==============

This is to keep track of the OAuth examples that may be given to our game developers to help implement the OAuth flow.


| Language | HTTP Client | OAuth Lib                |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------:               |
| Ruby     | Net::HTTP   | gem install simple_oauth |
| node.js  | builtin     | npm install oauth        |
| java     | Apache Commons HTTP Client | signpost  |
| php      | builtin     | pecl install oauth*      |

\* On OS X, it was easiest to install php5 and oauth via Homebrew.
